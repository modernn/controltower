![Control Tower](./artwork/control-tower-logo.png)

An [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) inspired .NET Core based 3D Printer controller that runs from your Raspberry PI.

## Goals

* Provide a .NET Core based solution for controlling your 3D printer
* Demonstrate how easy it is to run .NET Core on Raspberry PI
* Demonstrate how to use Blazor to build rich clientside applications

## Current status

I'm in the process of settings things up and learning how my own 3D printer communicates.
The project structure is set up, but definitely not complete!

## Documentation

The overall architecture and other information can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/wmeints/controltower/wiki).

## Helping out

Want to chip in and write some code? Cool, create a pull request and submit issues! I'd love to get some help with this project.
